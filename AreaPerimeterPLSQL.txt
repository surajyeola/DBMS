Write a PL/SQL code block to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle for a value of length varying from 10 to 20 and breadth varying from 5 to 10.  
Store the length and breadth and the corresponding values of the calculated area and perimeter in an empty table named areas, consisting of three  columns, length, breadth  and area. 

-- Step 1: Create the areas table
CREATE TABLE areas (
    length NUMBER,
    breadth NUMBER,
    area NUMBER
);

-- Step 2: Write the PL/SQL code block to calculate area and perimeter
DECLARE
    -- Variable declarations
    length NUMBER;
    breadth NUMBER;
    area NUMBER;
    perimeter NUMBER;
BEGIN
    -- Loop through each value of length from 10 to 20
    FOR length IN 10..20 LOOP
        -- Loop through each value of breadth from 5 to 10
        FOR breadth IN 5..10 LOOP
            -- Calculate area and perimeter
            area := length * breadth;
            perimeter := 2 * (length + breadth);
            
            -- Insert the length, breadth, and area into the areas table
            INSERT INTO areas (length, breadth, area)
            VALUES (length, breadth, area);
            
            -- Optionally, you can output the calculated values
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Length: ' || length || 
                                 ', Breadth: ' || breadth || 
                                 ', Area: ' || area || 
                                 ', Perimeter: ' || perimeter);
        END LOOP;
    END LOOP;
