Database Trigger (All Types: Row level and Statement level triggers, Before and After Triggers). 
Write a database trigger on the student table. 
The System should keep track of the records that are being  updated  or  deleted.  
The  old  value  of  updated  or  deleted  records  should  be  added  in the Student_Audit table (Action may be delete or update), date of action should be recorded.
Student(roll, name) 
Student_Audit (roll, name, action, date) 

-- Step 1: Create the Student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    roll NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100)
);

-- Step 2: Create the Student_Audit table to keep track of updates and deletions
CREATE TABLE Student_Audit (
    roll NUMBER,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    action VARCHAR2(10), -- Will store 'UPDATE' or 'DELETE'
    action_date DATE
);

-- Step 3: Create a BEFORE UPDATE Trigger for tracking updates
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_update_student
BEFORE UPDATE ON Student
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Insert the old values into Student_Audit table
    INSERT INTO Student_Audit (roll, name, action, action_date)
    VALUES (:OLD.roll, :OLD.name, 'UPDATE', SYSDATE);
END;
/

-- Step 4: Create a BEFORE DELETE Trigger for tracking deletions
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_delete_student
BEFORE DELETE ON Student
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Insert the old values into Student_Audit table
    INSERT INTO Student_Audit (roll, name, action, action_date)
    VALUES (:OLD.roll, :OLD.name, 'DELETE', SYSDATE);
END;
/

-- Optionally, test the triggers by performing UPDATE and DELETE operations
-- Insert sample data into Student table
INSERT INTO Student (roll, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
INSERT INTO Student (roll, name) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith');

-- Perform an update operation (this will trigger before_update_student)
UPDATE Student SET name = 'John A. Doe' WHERE roll = 1;

-- Perform a delete operation (this will trigger before_delete_student)
DELETE FROM Student WHERE roll = 2;

-- Query the Student_Audit table to verify results
SELECT * FROM Student_Audit;
